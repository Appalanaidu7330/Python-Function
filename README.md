1. Python Function 
ðŸ”¹ Definition:
A function in Python is a named block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions allow for code reuse and modular programming, making code easier to manage, test, and understand.

ðŸ”¹ Purpose:
*To avoid repetition of code.
*To divide complex problems into smaller, manageable sections.
*To improve code readability and structure.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Functions:
1.Built-in Functions:
Provided by Python (e.g., print(), len(), max()).
sub(), add(), greet().
2.User-defined Functions:
Created by programmers using the def keyword.

Created by programmers using the def keyword.
ðŸ”¹ Components of a Function:
*Function Name: The identifier used to call the function.
*Parameters: Optional inputs passed into the function.
*Function Body: The set of statements that define what the function does.
*Return Statement: Optional statement used to send a result back to the caller.

ðŸ”¹ Function Lifecycle:
*Definition: Declaring the function with a name and optional parameters.
*Invocation (Call): Executing the function using its name and providing necessary arguments.
*Execution: Performing the logic defined in the function body.
*Return: Optionally returning a value to the caller.

ðŸ”¹ Advantages of Using Functions:
*Code Reusability
*Modularity
*Easier Testing and Debugging
*Improved Readability
*Scalability
